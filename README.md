### Steps:
1. If you do not have [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed, please go ahead and install that first.

**Oct 30th update:**  
`search.html` &mdash; We're now using a tomtom plugin that helps with automated suggestions as the user types their query into the searchbox:  
[developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/tutorials/basic/searchbox-integration](https://developer.tomtom.com/maps-sdk-web-js/tutorials/basic/searchbox-integration)  

As such, we need to install npm for the search page to work properly.  

Open `htdocs > 4885_Buddy` in your Finder/File Explorer, then open it in terminal:  

**Mac:**  
(Right-click the `4885_Buddy` folder > `New Terminal at Folder`)

**Windows:**

Type `npm i` to install. 🎉  

When it's done, hard-refresh `search.html`. If you can see the events, congrats!
