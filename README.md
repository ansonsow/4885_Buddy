# 4885_Buddy
 
**Firebase update:**  
You need to remove the `4885_Buddy` folder from your *local* computer first, and reopen it through MAMP.  

### Steps:
1. Open where the `4885_Buddy` folder is on your computer, e.g. `User > Documents > GitHub > 4885_Buddy`, and trash it.
2. If you open GitHub Desktop, you should get a "Can't find 4885_Buddy" message. You can click `Remove`.
3. Clone the repository again:

4. For the folder destination, **make sure you put it inside your MAMP folder's `htdocs`**:

⭐ **do not** use the `User > Documents > GitHub` folder location.

5. Start MAMP.
