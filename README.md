# 4885_Buddy
 
I have created a firebase database and connect it to our project, in order to get it working in your machine, you need to first move the 4885_Buddy file under MAMP/htdocs, I suggest cloning into there from GitHub
open the file in your browser with localhols:8888/4885_Buddy
If you are able to see “hi this is test event” in the profile.html that means it worked!
Currently there is no security in our database since I have not figure out the authentication
