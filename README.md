### 👋 About:

Created as an academic project for the [WMDD program at Langara](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/index.html), the purpose of this project was to develop a B2C (business-to-consumer) app within 13 weeks, with the requirements being either implementing a camera or a map.

Buddy helps you discover new activities and connects you with people you're interested in. We offer a refreshing alternative to traditional social events with a myriad of unique features.
